DeviceUpdate:
  Fingerprint file is incorrect:
    Starting OS version: <1.8.0
    Target OS version: '>=1.0.0'
    Issue description: >-
      Earlier versions have fingerprints calculated wrong (missing files,
      fingerprints for files that are not in the OS, etc...), so the fingerprint
      cannot be trusted.


      This means that for these devices, forced update is required (running the
      updater with `-f` or `--force`), but do check the fingerprint file
      beforehand, to make sure it is sensible. Sometimes users have modified
      other files, in which case, force would break their stuff.


      Because of this, currently no known good way to allow self-service on
      these devices.

  Update-resin-supervisor is unable to query the API:
    Starting OS version: '>=2.0.8 || <2.7.0'
    Target OS version: '>=2.7.0'
    Issue description: >-
      A typo in update-resin-supervisor makes it unable to pull a supervisor
      based on API response, as the API call is done incorrectly using the
      device API key.
    Relevant scrips: >
      Use the update-resin-supervisor from the fixed version, by logging into
      the device and running:


      ```

      cd /tmp

      curl -O
      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resin-os/meta-resin/v2.7.0/meta-resin-common/recipes-containers/docker-disk/docker-resin-supervisor-disk/update-resin-supervisor

      bash update-resin-supervisor

  Supervisor cannot bootstrap itself:
    Starting OS version: <2.0.0
    Target OS version: '>=2.4.2'
    Issue description: >-
      When updating from a 1.x device, after reboot into the new system the
      device comes up without any docker images / containers. For some devices
      there's a logic issue in the `resin-supervisor.service`, so the device
      cannot recover from this stage by itself, need to pull the supervisor
      image explicitly (through the update service).


      * **no fix merged on meta-resin yet**

      * **need to add polyfill into resinHUP** (otherwise support issues galore)

      Need to run on the device `update-resin-supervisor` manually:

      ```
      systemctl start update-resin-supervisor

  Device had deviceApiKey but cannot use it:
    Starting OS version: <2.0.3
    Target OS version: '>2.0.0'
    Issue description: >-
      `Before supervisor v4.2.0, the device might have had `deviceApiKey` set,
      but not necessarily be able to use that. On these devices, need to use the
      `apiKey` for the API calls still
